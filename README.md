# Selecting-Substrings
Let p and q each be strings containing two words separated by a space.

Examples:

    "bell hooks"
    "grace hopper"
    "alonzo church"

Write a procedure called myfirst_yoursecond(p,q) that returns True if the first word in p equals the second word in q. Return False otherwise.
